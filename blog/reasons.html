        <p>Live is a journey of knowledge and self-knowledge. We need to clarify our why’s to be able to achieve things want. There are times we fail to do something because our will is shallow. And sometimes we give ourselves bad reasons when good one’s are available. By being able to rationalize our reasons we can live a truer, more motivated life.</p>

<h3 id="parents">Parents</h3>

<p>Who as a child never felt bullshitted by something your parents were saying was important?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Y: I want to go to the pool</li>
  <li>A: You have to wait until the evening</li>
  <li>Y: Why?</li>
  <li>A: A full belly and water don’t mix.</li>
  <li>Y: Why?</li>
  <li>A: Don’t go over there! Your going do drown!</li>
  <li>Y: Why?</li>
  <li>A: bla, bla, some bullshit here, bla, bla, because I say so, bla</li>
</ul>

<p>They don’t have the answers. And they are too arrogant to admit that most of the time, then they rely on authority.</p>

<p>The fact is most parents are simply children with children.</p>

<h2 id="teachers">Teachers</h2>

<p>Most teachers are barely an improvement.</p>

<p><em>Why is it important to study anything?</em></p>

<p>I went through middle school without a good answer to that. The one’s that were available to me were: to not fail your tests or stretching a bit: to get a job.</p>

<p>Many public school teachers in Brazil don’t even seem to be convinced themselves that the thing that they are trying to teach you is important.
Teachers can be so demotivating that no matter how much they try to scare you they will not convince you to do their stuff.</p>

<p><em>Why chemistry is important?</em></p>

<p>Because someone decided it’s on the curriculum and you will be held accountable to fail on answering the questions. I’ll make you swallow this list of formulas and apply on that test.</p>

<p>We leave school many times not realizing why it matters to study.</p>

<h2 id="my-firt-realization">My firt realization</h2>

<p>By the end of my middle-school, in an extra electronics course that I finally found good reasons for studying.</p>

<p>I could see where the math I was studying could be plainly applied to build things in the real world. I also saw my teacher as someone that knew a lot and was collecting amazing fruits with it. He had a good life. Was able to build cool stuff. Won some national prizes by his skills.</p>

<h2 id="going-deeper">Going deeper</h2>

<p>Much later I was able to link the efforts of knowledge with deeper and more poetic, numinous reasons.</p>

<p>The possibility to understand the world, to see beyond what our eyes can usually see. To be astonished by the only miracle worth the name: the universe. All the “ordinary” experiences are all but that when understood through the lens of science.</p>

<p>I’m sure I would be a better human being by simply knowing this things earlier.  And that should be the mission of the first years of education. First to introduce children to the wonders of the universe and the fact that science are the gateways of realization and progress. In fact there are good arguments for studying, just not the one’s people usually give.</p>

<h2 id="story-morals">Story morals</h2>

<p>Having being exposed to this miryiad of bad arguments, false excuses and motives through life is easy to see why most people fail in whatever they are trying in life.</p>

<p>Most of the time we are not capable of convincing ourselves enough that sometihing is worth the endeavour and end up giving up.
To succeed in life the most important person to convince is yourself.</p>

<p>Many times we may think that we are convinced that something is important. But we fail to act accordingly. Seems to me that this happens because at a deeper level we are still skeptical that the endeavour is worth it.</p>

<p>Any expert level activity requires not less than total commitment.
Most of the times we are not willingly to admit that. We think that progress should be quick. And we give up.</p>

<p>Being honest in knowing when to give up is also important. There’s some things that we start thinking that are the coolest things in the world to later realize that it’s not the case. Actually that other thing is cooler. Some people fail to change when they need. Convincing that what they have now is good enough. And later in life regret is what rests.</p>

<p>Either way, to trully achieve our dreams we need to be honest with ourselves. We need to have the introspection to inquire our own selves if our course of action is worth it. By exploring advantages and downsides we start know the thing we are interested on, it’s the being of discovery. The way of progress.</p>
