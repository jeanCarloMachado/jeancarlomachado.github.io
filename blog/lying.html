    <div class="post__content"?>
        <p>This is a summary/paraphrase with some complements from the small yet
resourceful book Lying from Ham Harris. I’m a big fan of Sam and this
book is a piece of extremely useful philosophical argument that each one of us can
upload to our operational systems and enjoy a better life. Given that I
thought was reasonable to write some lines about it and share here.</p>

<hr />

<p>Most people already believe that lying is wrong. Yet most of us do it all the
time. At least 1 study suggest that 10% of communication between spouses
is deceptive. 38% of encounters among collage students contain lies.
We may even think they are doing good when lying out of compassion
for others also known as white lies. Research suggest that all lies
incur in less satisfactory relationships. Even liars rate their
deceptive interactions as less pleasurable than honest one’s. Why do we
deliberately use a reliable source of suffering?</p>

<p>We may think it is moral to tell white lies. But by lying we deny the
receiver access to reality. And the resulting ignorance often harms them
in ways we did not anticipate. Our friends may act on our falsehoods.
Or fail to solve problems they could have solved only on basis of good
information. Rather often to lie is to infringe in the freedom of
those we care about. The more a person well being depends of a correct
understanding of the world the more the consequential the lie.</p>

<p>When a woman asks if she looks fat in her dress many people might think that
there’s only one reply possible: no. But if she really is and you say no you
may be preventing her to get honest information to be able to act on a problem
that is harming her life. She might deeply desire to find a husband and by
deceiving her you might be making her life harder.</p>

<p>To lie is to intentionally deceive others when they are expecting honest
communication. You can be truthful yet wrong. But communication your
level of degree in each interaction is a signal of honesty. In believing
one thing and indenting to communicate another is the essence of lying.</p>

<p>When we lie we assume that the other person is dangerous or
incapable to handle the truth. Sincerity, authenticity,
integrity and mutual understanding are destroyed the moment we
deliberately misrepresent our believes  Deeper relations possibilities are lost.</p>

<p>In the book Sam recalls the case where a mother, upon visiting the
doctor is discovered to have cancer. The doctor don’t tell her directly,
instead tells her husband which decides not to tell her at all. After
some months she goes to the library and diagnose herself. At some point
the situation worsens and she dies in the hospital bed. When finally the
hole family faces the situation. They spent all the time pretending.
What conversation they might have otherwise in order to prepare one
another for that moment and the future? What words that mother might
have said to their children on her last days if she was not committed to
deception? They end up better of with hiding?</p>

<p>Honesty can also force any dysfunction in your life to the
surface. As Tim Ferris once said “A person’s success in life can usually
be measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations he or she is
willing to have.” When you confront the truth at every moment you may
find that some relationships cannot be honestly maintained. That the way you’re
heading your life will lead to lesser well being than otherwise. An effort to
tell the truth may reveal truths about oneself.</p>

<p>In committing to be honest with everyone we commit to avoid a wide range of
long-term problems, at the cost of short-term discomfort. The discomfort should
not be exaggerated: The purpose of telling the truth is not offend people.
You simply want them to have the information you have.</p>

<p>When we tell lies we are usually loosing the opportunity to form deeper
bonds. Honesty is a gift we can give others. And honest people are a
refuge. With them, you know you will get honest feedback and praise
cannot be mistaken by mere flattery. Lying is precisely the sort of
behaviour we need to outgrow in order to build a better world.</p>
