    <div class="post__content"?>
        <p>I’ve been collecting quotes for a long time and I guess there’s no point in keeping them hidden.</p>

<p>As Robert Heaton says: “everyone should keep a pile of aphorisms lying around - you never know when you’ll need one”.</p>

<p>So here they are:</p>

<hr />

<p>Make sure you remain straightforward, upright,
reverent, serious, unadorned, an ally of justice, pious, kind,
affectionate, and doing your duty with a will. Fight to be the
person philosophy tried to make you.</p>

<p>Marcus Aurelius, Meditations</p>

<hr />

<p>All truth passes through three stages. First, it is ridiculed.
Second, it is violently opposed. Third, it is accepted as being
self evident.</p>

<p>Arthur Schopenhauer</p>

<hr />

<p>New discoveries still come to people as they did to Democritus,
sitting lost in thought in the market square of his city. They
come to people who so enjoy playing with ideas that eventually they
stray beyond the limits of what is known, and find themselves
exploring an uncharted territory</p>

<p>Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi</p>

<hr />

<p>My fate is to live among varied and confusing storms. But for you perhaps, if as I hope and wish you will live long after me, there will follow a better age. This sleep of forgetfulness will not last forever. When the darkness has been dispersed, our descendants can come again in the former pure radiance</p>

<p>Petrarch 1343</p>

<hr />

<p>For my part, I will not give in to fear of the unknown. We all have our role to play, and I hope only that when I have played mine, the world will have been better for my having been in it.</p>

<p>Candaith of the Dunedain</p>

<hr />

<p>Do the right thing instead of doing things right.</p>

<p>Don’t know :/</p>

<hr />

<p>Indeed the sage who’s fully quenched
Rests at ease in every way;
No sense desire adheres to him
Whose fires have cooled, deprived of fuel.</p>

<p>All attachments have been severed,
The heart’s been led away from pain;
Tranquil, he rests with utmost ease.
The mind has found it’s way to peace.</p>

<p>The Buddha Cullavagga 6:4:4</p>

<hr />

<p>Quem deseja seriamente se tornar livre perderá a inclinação para
erros e vícios, sem que nada o obrigue a isso; também a raiva e o
desgosto o assaltarão cada vez menos. Pois sua vontade não deseja nada
mais incessantemente do que o conhecimento e o meio de alcançá-lo, ou
seja: a condição duradoura em que ele está mais apto para o conhecer.</p>

<p>Nietzesche</p>

<hr />

<p>No art, however minor, demands less than total dedication if you want to excel
in it.</p>

<p>Alberti</p>

<hr />

<p>If everything is under control you are going too slow.</p>

<p>Mario Andretti</p>

<hr />

<p>The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new
landscapes, but in having new eyes.</p>

<p>Marcel Proust</p>

<hr />

<p>Whatever you do, or dream you can do, begin it. Boldness has
genius, power and magic in it. Begin it now</p>

<p>Faust, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</p>

<hr />

<p>If a little kid ever asks you just why the sky is blue, you look him or her in
the eye and say, It’s because of quantum effects involving ray light scattering
combined with a lack of violet photon receptors in our retinae</p>

<p>Phil Plait</p>

<hr />

<p>O meu gosto, que pode ser o contrário de um gosto tolerante, também
nisso está longe de dizer sim em bloco: ele absolutamente não gosta de
dizer sim, antes prefere dizer não e, mais do que tudo, prefere não
dizer nada.</p>

<p>Nietzesche</p>

<hr />

<p>Perfection is attained not when there is nothing more to add, but when
there is nothing more to remove.</p>

<p>Antoine de Saint-Exupéry</p>

<hr />

<p>If you say “I’m a unifier not a divider” you would expect and usually get
applause. I’m a divider. I think only division can cause progress.</p>

<p>Christopher Hitchens</p>

<hr />

<p>In character, in manner, in style, in all things, the supreme excellence is simplicity.</p>

<p>Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</p>

<hr />

<p>Vicarious participation is able to mask, at least temporarily the
underlying emptiness of wasted time. But it’s a very pale
substitute for attention invested in real challenges.</p>

<p>Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi</p>

<hr />

<p>When you have something to say silence is a lie.</p>

<p>Jordan Peterson</p>

<hr />

<p>Learning is like rowing upstream: not to advance is to drop back.</p>

<p>Chinese Proverb</p>

<hr />

<p>The deepest solace lies in understanding,
This ancient unseen stream,
A shudder before the beautiful</p>

<p>Richard Dawkins</p>

<hr />

<p>O que se anuncia na consciência individual como impulso sexual em
geral que não se dirige para um indivíduo determinado do outro sexo
é simplesmente a Vontade de vida em si mesma, e fora do fenômeno.
O que aparece porém na consciência como impulso sexual orientado
para um indivíduo determinado é, em si mesma, a Vontade enquanto
querer viver de um indivíduo precisamente determinado. Neste caso, o
impulso sexual, embora sendo de fato uma necessidade subjetiva, sabe
pôr, com habilidade, a máscara de uma admiração objetiva, iludindo
assim a consciência: pois a natureza precisa deste estratagema para
atingir os seus fins.</p>

<p>Schopenhauer</p>

<hr />

<p>A man can fail many times, but he isn’t a failure until he beings
to blame somebody else.</p>

<p>Jhon Burroughs</p>

<hr />

<p>Music is the voice that tells us that the human race is greater than it knows.</p>

<p>Napoleon Bonaparte</p>

<hr />

<p>Be hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise.</p>

<p>Dale Carnegie</p>

<hr />

<p>Toda criatura deve ter permissão para rodar seu próprio
desenvolvimento à sua própria maneira; a forma encontrada pelo ovo
pode ter um jeito bastante oblíquo de fazer as coisas; mas é a sua
maneira, da qual o homem, no geral, não tem grandes motivos para
se queixar. Por que dizemos que a ave é considerada mais viva que
o ovo, e por que dizemos que é a galinha que põe o ovo, e não
o ovo que põe a galinha, são questões que estão além do poder da
explicação filosófica, mas talvez sejam mais passíveis de resposta
se pensarmos na vaidade do homem, e em seu hábito, comprovado
durante muitas eras, de ignorar tudo aquilo que não o lembre de si
mesmo.</p>

<p>Samuel Butler</p>

<hr />

<p>As ideias retiveram algumas das propriedades dos organismos. Assim
como eles, as ideias tendem a perpetuar sua estrutura e a se
reproduzir; elas também podem se fundir, se recombinar, segregar
seu conteúdo; de fato, também elas podem evoluir e, nessa
evolução, a seleção sem dúvida desempenha um papel importante.</p>

<p>Monod</p>

<hr />

<p>Morrer por uma ideia é uma atitude de nobreza inquestionável, mas
seria ainda mais nobre se os homens morressem por ideias
verdadeiras.</p>

<p>H. L. Mencken</p>

<hr />

<p>The winds and waves are always on the side of the ablest navigators.</p>

<p>Edward Gibbon</p>

<hr />

<p>Não devemos admitir um número maior de causas para os fenômenos
naturais do  aquele ao mesmo tempo verdadeiro e suficiente para
explicar sua aparência.</p>

<p>Newton</p>

<hr />

<p>Time and health are two precious assets that we don’t recognize
and appreciate until they have been depleted.</p>

<p>Denis Waitley</p>

<hr />

<p>When you’re tired you sleep, and when you’re not, you do physics.</p>

<p>Sabrina Pasterski</p>

<hr />

<p>Somos filhos da história, e precisamos definir nossos próprios
caminhos neste que é o mais diversificado e interessante dos
universos concebíveis - um que é indiferente ao nosso sofrimento,
portanto nos oferece o máximo de liberdade para prosperar, ou
fracassar, da forma como escolhermos.</p>

<p>Christopher Hitchens</p>

<hr />

<p>Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations
we can perform without thinking.</p>

<p>Alfred North Whitehead</p>

<hr />

<p>A person’s success in life can usually be measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations he or she is willing to have.</p>

<p>Tim Ferriss</p>

<hr />

<p>Dou por concluído, com isso, tudo o que eu queria demonstrar a
respeito do poder da mente sobre os afetos e sobre a liberdade da
mente. Torna-se, com isso, evidente o quanto vale o que sabe e o
quanto ele é superior ao ignorante, que se deixa levar apenas
pelo apetite lúbrico. Pois o ignorante, além de ser agitado, de
muitas maneiras, pelas causas exteriores, e de nunca gozar da
verdadeira satisfação do animo, vive, ainda, quase inconsciente
de si mesmo, de Deus e das coisas, e tão logo deixa de padecer,
deixa também de ser. Por outro lado, o sábio, enquanto
considerado como tal, dificilmente tem o animo perturbado. Em vez
disso, consciente de si mesmo, de Deus e das coisas, em virtude
de uma certa necessidade eterna, nunca deixa de ser, mas
desfruta, sempre, da verdadeira satisfação do animo. Se o caminho,
conforme já, demonstrei , que conduz a isso parece muito árduo,
ele pode, entretanto, ser encontrado. E deve ser certamente árduo
aquilo que raramente se encontra. Pois se a salvação estivesse à
disposição e pudesse ser encontrada sem maior esforço, como
explicar que ela seja negligenciada por quase todos? Mas tudo o
que é precioso é tão difícil quanto raro.</p>

<p>Baruch de Spinoza</p>

<hr />

<p>Few of us realize that we spent most of our lives in such a state:
perceiving the present - present sights, sounds, tastes and
sensations - only dimly, through a veil of thought. We spend our
lives telling ourselves the story of past and future, while the
reality of the present goes largely unexplored. Now we live in
ignorance of the freedom and simplicity of consciousness, prior to
the arising of thought.</p>

<p>Sam Harris</p>

<hr />

<p>Never be a spectator of unfairness or stupidity. The grave will
supply plenty of time for silence.</p>

<p>Christopher Hitchens</p>

<hr />

<p>Design is not making beauty: beauty emerges from selection,
affinities, integration, love.</p>

<p>Louis Kahn</p>

<hr />

<p>The mind is not a vessel to be filled, but a fire to be kindled.</p>

<p>Mestrius Plutarchos</p>

<hr />

<p>It is by logic we prove; it is by intuition we discover.</p>

<p>Henri Poincaré</p>

<hr />

<p>A man’s erros are his portals of discovery.</p>

<p>James Joyce</p>

<hr />

<p>People look without seeing, hear without listening, eat without
awareness of taste, touch without feeling, and talk without
thinking.</p>

<p>Leonardo da Vince</p>

<hr />

<p>Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.</p>

<p>Wendell Phillips</p>

<hr />

<p>Don’t take refuge on the false security of consensus.</p>

<p>Christopher Hitchens</p>

<hr />

<p>A wise man proportions his beliefs to the evidence.</p>

<p>Hume</p>

<hr />

<p>No legacy is so rich as honesty.</p>

<p>William Shakespeare</p>

<hr />

<p>Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth but supreme beauty –
a beauty cold and austere, like that of a sculpture, without appeal to any
part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trapping of painting or music,
yet sublimely pure, and capable of a stern perfection such as only the
greatest art can show.  The true spirit of delight, the exaltation, the sense
of being more than man, which is the touchstone of the highest excellence, is
to be found in mathematics as surely as in poetry.</p>

<p>Bertrand Russell</p>

<hr />

<p>Gradually I learned to be indifferent to myself and my
deficiencies; I came to center my attention increasingly upon
external objects: the state of the world, various branches of
knowledge, individuals for whom I felt affection.</p>

<p>Bertrand Russel</p>

<hr />

<p>Everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing a
program in the first place. So if you’re as clever as you can be
when you write it, how will you ever debug it?</p>

<p>Brian W. Kernighan</p>

<hr />

<p>Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from
magic.</p>

<p>Arthur C. Clarke</p>

<hr />

<p>All non-trivial abstractions, to some degree, are leaky.</p>

<p>Abstractions fail. Sometimes a little, sometimes a lot. There’s
leakage. Things go wrong. It happens all over the place when you
have abstractions.</p>

<p>Joel Spolsky</p>

<hr />

<p>Everything around you that you call life was made up by people
that we’re no smarter than you and you can change it, you can
influence it, you can build your own things that other people can
use.</p>

<p>Steve Jobs</p>

<hr />

<p>Everything flows and nothing abides; everything gives way and
nothing stays fixed.</p>

<p>Heraclitus</p>

<hr />

<p>It is not every question that deserves an answer.</p>

<p>Publilius Syrus</p>

<hr />

<p>Relatively simple things can tolerate a certain level of
disorganization. However, as complexity increases, disorganization
becomes suicidal.</p>

<p>Robert Martin</p>

<hr />

<p>There is surely not quite so useless as doing with great efficiency what should not be done at all.</p>

<p>Peter Drucker</p>

<hr />

<p>The best architect removes architecture.</p>

<p>Martin Fowler</p>

<hr />

<p>Justice is subject to dispute; might is easily recognized and not
disputed. So we cannot give might to justice.</p>

<p>Blaise Pascal</p>

<hr />

<p>I have long since learned, as a measure of elementary hygiene, to
be on guard when anyone quotes Pascal.</p>

<p>José Ortega y Gasset</p>

<hr />

<p>The kingdom of Heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among
the wheat, and went away.</p>

<p>Jesus</p>

<hr />

<p>Pain is inevitable, suffering is not.</p>

<p>H. Gunaratana</p>

<hr />

<p>Genuíno tipo – crioulo - rio-grandense (hoje tão modificado), era
Blau o guasca sadio, a um tempo leal e ingênuo, impulsivo na
alegria e na temeridade, precavido, perspicaz, sóbrio e
infatigável; e dotado de uma memória de rara nitidez brilhando
através de imaginosas e encantadora loquacidade servida e floreada
pelo vivo e pitoresco dialeto gauchesco. (…) olhava pra gente,
como o sol olha pra água: atravessando.</p>

<p>Simões Lopes Neto</p>

<hr />

<p>All noble things are as difficult as they are rare.</p>

<p>Spinoza</p>

<hr />

<p>It is forbidden to kill; therefore all murderers are punished
unless they kill in large numbers and to the sound of trumpets.</p>

<p>Voltaire</p>

<hr />

<p>You have to demonstrate your ability first, and then you have the freedom to do it.</p>

<p>Richard Hamming</p>

<hr />

<p>Correctness is clearly the prime quality. If a system does not do what
it is supposed to do, then everything else about it matters little.</p>

<p>Bertrand Meyer</p>

<hr />

<p>Philosophy is written in that great book which ever lies before our
eyes, I mean the universe, but we cannot understand it if we do not
first learn the language and grasp the symbols, in which it is written.
This book is written in the mathematical language… without which one
wanders in vain through a dark labyrinth.</p>

<p>Anonymous</p>

<hr />

<p>The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant
character in all fiction: jealous and proud of it; a petty, unjust,
unforgiving control-freak; a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser;
a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal,
pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent
bully.</p>

<p>Richard Dawkins</p>

<hr />

<p>Irony is wasted on the stupid</p>

<p>Oscar Wilde</p>

<hr />

<p>Human behavior flows from three main sources: desire, emotion, and
knowledge.</p>

<p>Plato</p>

<hr />

<p>The best teacher I had in graduate school spent the whole semester destroying any beliefs we had about computing. He was a real iconoclast. He happened to be a genius, so we took it. At the end of the course, we were free because we didn’t believe in anything. We had to learn everything, but then he destroyed it. He wanted us to understand what had been done, but he didn’t want us to believe in it.</p>

<p>– Alan Kay</p>

<hr />

<p>The root of compassion is compassion for one self.</p>

<p>Pema Chodron</p>

<hr />

<p>And the things that conduce in any way the convenience of life,
and of which fortune gives an abundant supply, he used without
arrogance and without excusing himself; so that when he had them,
he enjoyed them without affectation, and when he had them not, he
did not want them.</p>

<p>Marcus Aurelius, Meditations</p>

<p>Mark Zuckenberg</p>

<p>If we could read the secret history of our enemies, we should find in each person’s life sorrow and suffering enough to disarm any hostility.</p>

<p>80 percent of success is showing up</p>

<p>Woody Allen</p>

<hr />

<p>Virtually all narutal systems, from ecossystems to animals to
organizations, have intrinsically optimal rates of growth.
The optimal rate is  far less then the fastest possible growth.
When growth becomes excessive - as it does on cancer - the system
itself will seek to compensate by slowing down; perhaps putting
the organization survival at risk in the proccess.</p>

<p>Vince Lombardi Jr.</p>

<hr />

<p>Os que não tem experiência da sabedoria e da virtude, que estão
sempre em festas e diversões semelhantes, são levados, ao que me
parece, para baixo, e depois, novamente, até a região intermediária,
e por aí andam errantes toda a vida, sem jamais ultrapassarem esse
limite, erguendo os olhos ou elevando-se até o verdadeiro alto, nem se
encheram realmente do ser, nem provaram o que é um prazer sólido e
puro; mas, olhando sempre para baixo, à maneira dos animais, inclinados
para o chão e para a mesa, engordam e acasalam-se, e, devido à cupidez
de tal gozo, dilaceram-se e batem uns nos outros com os seus férreos
chifres e cascos, matando-se por causa do seu apetite insaciável,
porquanto não enchem de alimentos reais a parte real e estanque de si
mesmos.</p>

<p>Euripides</p>

<hr />

<p>If you just sit and observe, you will see how restless your mind is. If you try to calm it, it only makes it worse, but over time it does calm, and when it does, there’s room to hear more subtle things — that’s when your intuition starts to blossom and you start to see things more clearly and be in the present more. Your mind just slows down, and you see a tremendous expanse in the moment. You see so much more than you could see before.</p>

<p>O fato de uma opinião ser amplamente compartilhada não é nenhuma evidência de que não seja completamente absurda; de fato, tendo-se em vista a maioria da humanidade, é mais provável que uma opinião difundida seja tola do que sensata.</p>

<p>Bertrand Russell</p>

<hr />

<p>A descoberta da moral cristã é um acontecimento que não tem igual,
uma verdadeira catástrofe. Quem sobre ela informa é uma <em>force
majeure</em>, um destino - divide a história da humanidade em duas partes.
A dos que antes vieram, a dos que depois viverão. O raio da verdade
atingiu justamente o que até agora mais alto se encontrava: quem
compreender o que aí se destruiu veja se em geral ainda tem algo nas
mãos. Tudo o que até agora se chamou verdade reconhece-se como a
forma mais prejudicial, mais pérfida e mais subterrânea da mentira.
O pretexto sagrado de tornar melhor a humanidade surge como a astúcia
para esgotar a própria vida, para a tornar anêmica. A moral como
vampirismo. Quem descobre a moral descobre com ela a ausência de valor
de todos os valores em que se acredita ou se acreditava; nos tipos mais
venerados, e até mesmo canonizados, do homem já nada vê digno de
veneração, divisa aí a forma mais fatal dos abortos, fatal, porque
eles fascinavam.</p>

<p>O conceito de deus foi inventado como o conceito de antiético à
vida - nele se encontra condensado, numa unidade atroz, tudo o que é
prejudicial, venenoso, caluniador, toda a hostilidade mortal contra
a vida. O conceito de além, de mundo verdadeiro, foi inventado para
desvalorizar o único mundo que existe - para destituir a nossa
realidade terrena de todo o fim, de toda a razão, de todo o propósito.</p>

<p>O conceito de alma, de espírito, finalmente ainda de alma imortal,
inventou-se para desprezar o corpo, para o tornar doente - santo, para
se deparar com uma horrível incúria em todas as coisas que na vida
merecem seriedade, as questões da alimentação, habitação, dieta
espiritual, cuidado com os doentes, higiene, tempo! Em vez da saúde,
a salvação da alma - quer dizer uma <em>folie circulaire</em> entre as
convulsões da penitência e a histeria da redenção.</p>

<p>O conceito de pecado foi inventado, juntamente com o
instrumento complementar da tortura, a noção de vontade livre,
para extraviar os instintos, para transformar em segunda natureza a
desconfiança para com os instintos.</p>

<p>No conceito de desinteresse, de
renúncia de si mesmo, encontra-se o genuíno sinal de <em>decádence</em>;
o engodo pelo maléfico, a incapacidade de já não encontrar a
sua utilidade, a autodestruição, tornaram-se em geral qualidades
distintivas, o dever, a santidade, o divino no homem.</p>

<p>Por fim - e é o mais terrível - no conceito de homem bom, torna-se o
partido de tudo que é fraco, doente, falhado, do que em si mesmo é
passivo, de tudo o que deve perecer - a lei da seleção é contrariada,
e faz-se um ideal a partir da oposição ao homem altivo e bem sucedido,
ao homem que diz sim, ao homem que garante e está certo do futuro -
este torna-se agora o mau. E em tudo isto acreditou como moral. Escassez
infame.</p>

<p>Look around you, nature demands our attention, beg’s us to explore, to question. Religion can provide only fossils ultimately not satisfiable answers; science, in constantly seeking real explanations, constantly reveals the true majesty of our world in all it’s complexity. People sometimes say: there’s must be more than just this world, than just this life, but how much more do you want? We are going to die and that makes us the lucky ones; most people are never going to die because their never going to be born. The number of people who could be here in my place outnumber the sand grains of Sahara. If you think in all different ways that our genes can be permuted, you and I are quite grotesquely lucky to be here. The number of events that have to happen in order for you to exist; in order for me to exist - we are privileged to be alive and we should make the most of our time on this world.</p>

at once, without uniting them into one, by which it gets tall it’s Ideias of
relationships. 3. The third is separating them from all other ideas that
accompany them in their real existence: this is called abstraction and thus all

<p>Aprender a ver - habituar o olho à calma, à paciência, a deixar que as coisas se aproximem; adiar o juízo, aprender a envolver e cercar o caso particular por todos os lados. Esta é a primeira preparação para a primeira espiritualidade: não reagir imediatamente a um estímulo, mas lançar mão dos instintos que inibem e isolam. Aprender a ver, segundo compreendo, é quase aquilo que o modo de falar não filosófico chama de vontade forte: o essencial, aí, é precisamente não “querer”, é poder suspender a decisão. Toda falta de espiritualidade, toda vulgaridade, repousa sobre a incapacidade de resistir a um estímulo - é preciso reagir, segue-se cada impulso. Em muitos casos, semelhante coação já é patologia, declínio, sintoma de esgotamento - quase tudo que a rudeza não filosófica designa pelo nome “vício” é apenas essa incapacidade fisiológica de não resistir.</p>

how to maintain order in a finite, but very large, discrete universe

challenge is how to mould what you have achieved in solving the first
problem, into a teachable discipline: it does not suffice to hone your
own intellect (that will join you in your grave), you must teach others
how to hone theirs. The more you concentrate on these two challenges,
the clearer you will see that they are only two sides of the same coin:
teaching yourself is discovering what is teachable.</p>

penis, a brief seizure and a little cloudy liquid. Perceptions like
that—latching onto things and piercing through them, so we see what

how pointless they are, to strip away the legend that encrusts them.</p>

the need of some kind of parent figure to turn to.</p>

<p>I think when we grow up we need to cast that aside and stand up tall in
the universe. And it’s cold and we are not gonna last forever. We all
gonna die and we face up to that. And I think that’s a nobler way of
getting through life than to pin your hopes on childhood illusions.</p>

<p>Richard Dawkins</p>

<p>Any sufficiently complicated C or Fortran program contains

<p>Of all tyrannies, a tyranny exercised for the good of its
victims may be the most oppressive.
C. S. Lewis</p>

<hr />

<p>Oh, olhai essas choupanas que esses sacerdotes construíram para
si! Igrejas chamam eles a tais antros de cheiro adocicado. Oh, nessa
falsa luz, esse ar abafado! Aqui, onde a alma, para elevar-se à sua
eminência, não tem o direito de voar! Senão que, ao contrário, assim
manda a sua fé: Subi a escada de joelhos pecadores! E não souberam
amar o seu deus de outro modo, senão crucificando o homem!</p>

<p>Nietzesche</p>

<hr />

<p>O meu gosto, que pode ser o contrário de um gosto tolerante, também

dizer sim, antes prefere dizer não e, mais do que tudo, prefere não
dizer nada.</p>

<p>Nietzsche</p>

<hr />

<p>Meditation is the discovery that the point of life is always arrived at in the immediate moment. –Alan Watts</p>

Hold infinity in the palm of your hand
And eternity in an hour</p>

<hr />

<p>Science flies you to the moon religion flies you into buildings</p>

<p>Victor Stenger</p>

<hr />

<p>Take the risk for thinking for yourself
Much more happiness, truth, beauty and wisdom

<p>Sam Harris</p>

<hr />

<p>Three virtues of a programmer</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Laziness: The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce
overall energy expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving programs
/hat other people will find useful and document what you wrote so you
don’t have to answer so many questions about it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Impatience: The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy. This
makes you write programs that don’t just react to your needs, but
actually anticipate them. Or at least pretend to.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hubris: The quality that makes you write (and maintain) programs that
other people won’t want to say bad things about.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Larry Wall</p>

<hr />

<p>You don’t give a person a big chance to do something great if he did not already demonstrate greatness</p>
