    <h1 class="post__title">(WIP) Relearning learning - The first 20 hours review</h1>
    <p class="post__date">November 18, 2018</p>

    <div class="post__content"?>
        <p>This post is a self-analysis based on the book The first 20 hours from Josh
Kaufman. What spark this reading was I got this book recommendation at
the agile rock conference in Ukraine. But, earlier than that I’ve watched the
TED talk before liked it but did not take the subject seriously. Now I
see this matters differently.</p>

<p>There are some many things one might feel curiosity through out life,
and not enough time. But, learning new skills should not be a hard thing
that we are able to do 2 or 3 times throughout life. History is full of examples of polymath human being who experienced most diverse set of moments. Still there are some topics which are dear to our hearts or important to our future that we reliably fail to master.</p>

<p>Now I’m failing to learn German, which I need very much. I’m always
under performing my desired knowledge of Math. For a while I’ve been
wanting to learn Clojure for real. I also always wanted to play music,
and so far not with great success.</p>

<p>All these stuff are for years in my to-do list, tried some times, it’s
demoralizing. How to fix this? This is the purpose of the first 20 hours
book.</p>

<p>The Kaufman break down the problem of learning hard stuff into a model with small steps.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Choose a lovable project</li>
  <li>Focus energy on one skill at a time</li>
  <li>Define your target performance level</li>
  <li>Deconstruct the skill into sub-skills</li>
  <li>Obtain critical tools</li>
  <li>Eliminate barriers to practice</li>
  <li>Make dedicated time for practice</li>
  <li>Create fast feedback loops</li>
  <li>Practice by the clock in short bursts</li>
  <li>Emphasize quantity and speed</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="choose-a-lovable-project">Choose a lovable project</h2>

<p>No mystery here. There are innumerable things one might be interested on.</p>

<h2 id="focus-energy-on-one-skill-at-a-time">Focus Energy on one skill at a time</h2>

<p>Pick only one thing to work on. We usually don’t realize we don’t have too much time.
The author defends that one will need to commit at least 20 hours to overcome the self-doubt bearer.</p>

<p>A simple formula is to stick with a skill for a month and spend one hour per day on it.</p>

<p>Historically I failed reliably in this aspect, always trying to do too much.
My mindset always revolved around multi-tasking. Studying a monad paper, category theory, closure and German at the same time. Then I had never had invested enough time in them and always frustrated my goals.</p>

<h2 id="define-your-target-performance-level">Define your target performance level</h2>

<p>I don’t want to become a German master. I just want to be able to have meaningful conversations.
But without clarifying this I might study things that bear no relevance into my desired target level, much slowing the acquisition of my skill.</p>

<h2 id="deconstruct-the-problem">Deconstruct the problem</h2>

<p>I can relate very much with what he describes as a matter of learning in my craft of software. To break down the problem and tackle the most important problem first.</p>

<p>Without this breakdown we go blindly in the problem hoping to be covering a good part of the skill in our practice sessions.</p>

<h2 id="obtain-critical-tools">Obtain critical tools</h2>

<p>Software in general, and most of the skills I want to practice are mental one’s and usually don’t require new purchases. Either way is good to keep the practice  of questioning.</p>

<p>One detail that kept me slow while trying to learn German is that Duolingo experience was very poor at my mobile, because the mobile was very bad.
Since I changed it things improved.</p>

<h2 id="eliminate-barriers-to-practice">Eliminate barriers to practice</h2>

<p>Make doing things stupid harder and the goal you want easier.
Remove Instagram from your computer.</p>

<h2 id="make-dedicated-time-for-practice">Make dedicated time for practice</h2>

<p>The only time you can choose to practice is today.
Not tomorrow. Not next week. Not next month or next year. Today.
When you wake up in the morning, you have a choice. You can choose
to invest your time acquiring skills that will make your life more
successful, enjoyable, and rewarding … or you can squander your time
doing something else.</p>

<h2 id="create-fast-feedback-loops">Create fast feedback loops</h2>

<p>Many skills don’t have a definitive measurement of progress but one can be creative. In German there are standardized tests. But the sound of it is boring.
I’ll have do a much better work going forward on how to measure myself.</p>

<h2 id="practice-by-the-clock-in-short-bursts">Practice by the clock in short bursts</h2>

<p>Its easy to get bored if we spend too much time doing the same. We have to acknowledge our own psychology flaws.</p>

<h2 id="emphasize-quantity-and-speed">Emphasize quantity and speed</h2>

<p>I’ve been trying to master the violin for a while. But the standard
method is supposed to take 4 years. This is too much, too boring, I dont
want to learn like this.</p>

<h2 id="my-major-flaws-given-the-model">My major flaws given the model</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Not breaking down the problem and focusing on the main important parts</li>
  <li>not defining the target performance</li>
  <li>not measuring partial performance</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="books">Books</h2>

<p>For a while I’ve been trying to learn by books. The though process
was something like these: “this is the best book there is about this
subject, so if I go through it I’ll learn it.” I can attest It does not work.
My experience proved that this method does not work to acquire skills.
Going through a book is too passive.  One needs to practicei, practice is the key to acquire skills.</p>

<p>So this means that everything will change from now on?
I’m not sure, probably not, but I’ll certainly be more mindful about studying.</p>
