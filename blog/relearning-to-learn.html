    <div class="post__content"?>
        <p>This post is a review from the book The first 20 hours from Josh
Kaufman. What spark this reading was I got this book recommendation at
the agile conference in Ukraine. But, earlier than that I’ve watched the
TED talk before liked it but did not take the subject seriously. Now I
see this matters differently.</p>

<p>We have so much we want to learn in life, and not enough time. But,
learning should not be hard, children do it like crazy. Still there are
some topics which are dear to our hearts or important to our future that
we reliably fail to master.</p>

<p>Now I’m failing to learn German, which I need very much. I’m always
under performing my desired knowledge of Math. For a while I’ve been
wanting to learn Clojure for real. I also always wanted to play music,
and so far not with great success.</p>

<p>All these stuff are for years in my todo list, tried some times, it’s
demoralizing. How to fix this? This is the purpose of the first 20 hours
book.</p>

<p>The Kaufman break down the problem of learning hard stuff into a model with small steps.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Choose a lovable project</li>
  <li>Focus energy on one skill at a time</li>
  <li>Define your target performance level</li>
  <li>Deconstruct the skill into sub-skills</li>
  <li>Obtain critical tools</li>
  <li>Eliminate barriers to practice</li>
  <li>Make dedicated time for practice</li>
  <li>Create fast feedback loops</li>
  <li>Practice by the clock in short bursts</li>
  <li>Emphasize quantity and speed</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="choose-a-lovable-project">Choose a lovable project</h2>

<p>No mystery here.</p>

<h2 id="focus-energy-on-one-skill-at-a-time">Focus Energy on one skill at a time</h2>

<p>Pick only one thing to work on. We usually don’t realize we don’t have too much time.
Can I choose a single thing per month?
Like not reading search papers of functional programming?
Yes, I don’t dot that either way.
And they are not skill givers either way.</p>

<h2 id="define-your-target-performance-level">Define your target performance level</h2>

<p>I don’t want to become a German master. I just want to be able to have conversations.</p>

<h2 id="deconstruct-the-problem">Deconstruct the problem</h2>

<p>I can relate very much with what he describes as a matter of learning in my craft of software. To break down the problem and tackle the most important problem first.</p>

<h2 id="obtain-critical-tools">Obtain critical tools</h2>

<h2 id="eliminate-barriers-to-practice">Eliminate barriers to practice</h2>

<p>Make doing things stupid harder and the goal you want easier.
Remove Instagram from your computer.</p>

<h2 id="make-dedicated-time-for-practice">Make dedicated time for practice</h2>

<p>The only time you can choose to practice is today.
Not tomorrow. Not next week. Not next month or next year. Today.
When you wake up in the morning, you have a choice. You can choose
to invest your time acquiring skills that will make your life more
successful, enjoyable, and rewarding … or you can squander your time
doing something else.</p>

<h2 id="create-fast-feedback-loops">Create fast feedback loops</h2>

<p>Measure yourself.</p>

<h2 id="practice-by-the-clock-in-short-bursts">Practice by the clock in short bursts</h2>

<p>Its easy to get bored if we spend too much time doing the same. We have to acknowledge our own psychology flaws.</p>

<h2 id="emphasize-quantity-and-speed">Emphasize quantity and speed</h2>

<p>Ive been trying to master the violin for a while. But the standard
method is supposed to take 4 years. This is too much, too boring, I dont
want to learn like this.</p>

<h2 id="my-major-flaws-given-the-model">My major flaws given the model</h2>

<ul>
  <li>not committing with one thing only</li>
  <li>Not precommiting with a timebox</li>
  <li>Not breaking down the problem and focusing on the main important parts</li>
  <li>not defining the target performance</li>
  <li>not measuring partial performance</li>
</ul>

<p>For a while I’ve been trying to learn by books. The though process
was something like these: “this is the best book there is about this
subject, so if I go through it I’ll learn it.” I can attest It does not work. These
topics are too hard to learn by going though a book. One needs to
practice. And this is the key to acquire skills.</p>

<p>So this means that everything will change from now on?
I’m not sure, probably not, but I’ll certainly be more mindful about studying.</p>
