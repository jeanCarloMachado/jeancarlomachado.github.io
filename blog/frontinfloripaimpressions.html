    <div class="post__content"?>
        <p>This Saturday I went to Front in Floripa with a friend (Vinicius Dacal). I don’t lie
on my blog: in the beginning I felt like the only stranger (backend
developer) on unwelcome lands. But this impression quickly dissolved and
in the end I had a really good time. The talks we’re good, whether, the
place,food and mainly the people.</p>

<p>Really all the talks we’re nice, but here is some of the
stronger impressions I got from some of them:</p>

<hr />

<p>I saw tiny useful tips on the JavaScript secrets talk.
Like functional methods, some entirely new for me, others that I didn’t
knew existed on JavaScript.</p>

<p>The animations lecture gave some nice insights about how animations
are built for real, in places like Disney. And I got this nice book
recommendation:  The illusion of the life.
I discover about <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/web-animations/">WebAnimation</a> specification on this talk as well.</p>

<p>The talk about dss was nice as well, you can checkout the
project <a href="https://github.com/guisouza/dss">here</a>. Gui talked about
constantly improving as well, about the importance of being the
in a place where you are the least knowledgeable of all. I cannot
agree fully on it but certainly it injected some reflections on my
mind.</p>

<p>On a pause we talked with Juarez and Raphael, about jobs, new
tendencies, cities, OS’s and lots of other things.</p>

<p>Afterwards we saw Raphael talking about WEBGL and I’m really impressed
about this guy. The knows a lot and is extremely new, and tries to be funny :P. He
gave me new inspiration towards game (mainly 3D) development.</p>

<p>Juarez talked about Ionic. I liked how much you can accomplish In
little time with Ionic. But it, as well, seems like the Wordpress
of mobiles, don’t get me wrong - it’s not a bad thing - only don’t
fit with my preferences.</p>

<p>I don’t recall which of the talkers said but here I’ll quote:
“ You don’t need to know all the insane collections of technologies
available for frontend nowadays. What  matters is that you know about
them in a way that, when you need some of them, you will now the tool
you need exists, then you can learn and apply them. “</p>

<hr />

<p>In the end of the event we went to a pub. We got a ride with a nice guy
and talked about work experiences on the trip.</p>

<p>Everyone was really gentle and funny. We got some free beer and I really
hope I could stay longer.</p>

<p>Leaving the pub I was stopped by a guy who says he knew me, he
read some of my posts and checkout my profile on Wakatime and
encouraged me to send a talk on PHP SC. It was great :).</p>

<p>In the journey home we talked about what matters in this kind of
events is the feeling, that inspiration one’s get. You don’t need
really advanced talks to get it, and certainly will not get it
from YouTube. I think this is the most important aspect of
participating of events. You may not learn awesome new things, but
you will see people like you, struggling with similar problems. You
will see their will to overcome these problems and make others life
easier. And you see all of it and see the same on yourself, and This
serves as an fuel for your technology aspirations.</p>

<p>To resume it was a nice day and certainly I will not miss the next
edition, and stay longer next time as well.</p>
