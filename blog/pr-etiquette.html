        <p>Many problems can arise when creating pull requests.  Here are a list of tips to avoid them.</p>

<h2 id="pr-paralysis">PR Paralysis</h2>

<p>Maybe the biggest problems with PRs is the PR paralysis. When someone stay blocked and cannot proceed working until someone else intervenes in the PR.</p>

<p>Here my suggestion is: do not wait for approval after the first round of comments. Reviewers should comment on everything they can in the first round.  If the reviewer really needs you to make a change before proceeding he/she should use the “require changes” option in Github.</p>

<p>We want to avoid the typical unprofessional PR:</p>
<ul>
  <li>reviewer adds a comment</li>
  <li>dev fixes or reply</li>
  <li>reviewer goes back to the pr and find another one</li>
  <li>dev fixes or reply</li>
</ul>

<p>and so on and so on…</p>

<p>Once you fixed the points or “settled the case” with your reply you should merge without requiring the green badge of approval by the reviewer. The idea is that everyone in the team is given trust to merge if they know the reviewer will be satisfied with the answer.</p>

<h2 id="too-many-pull-requests">Too many pull requests</h2>

<p>Reviews flood in order to keep process may also be a problem. Not everything should be reviewed.  If some change is small enough or inconsequential enough, use your good sense and just merge it. Here again we deposit trust in our team members and left their good judgment to rule.</p>

<h2 id="involve-the-minimum-amount-responsible-of-people">Involve the minimum amount responsible of people</h2>

<p>On the other hand, another problem that might arise with PRs is the merge without consent.  If you are doing a consequential change in the future of the software you should involve senior engineers.  At the same time include only the minimum amount of people that is responsible to get the thing done responsible, you gut will give you the sense. We are not looking for consensus in a PR. First of all is about correctness , second is about non-functional requirements, readability, etc.</p>

<h2 id="keep-it-objective">Keep it objective</h2>

<p>Now regarding the PR objectiveness.  If you are a reviewer be careful not to introduce topics that are totally unrelated with the PR at hand. You can reach-out the person, create tickets, but the PR should not fix all the problems of the world.</p>

<p>In the end of the day, is your responsibility as the PR creator to get the task to done. If the reviewers are taking too long to do their job is your responsibility to go after them and push them to finish reviewing.</p>
