    <div class="post__content"?>
        <p>This is an attempt to improve my actions over the opinions (that I’m
about to elaborate here) in the unceasing pursue of becoming a more
coherent person.</p>

<h2 id="the-web-movement-i-fully-embrace-the-open-web-movement">The web movement I fully embrace the open web movement.</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/why-designers-should-say-n
o-native-apps-51514978">Here</a> are some reasons you should too, independently
if you are a computer scientist or not. By doing so I completely refuse
the native approach. So Android and IOS apps are totally incoherent with
my visions - either for software creation or consuming.</p>

<h2 id="creation-vs-consuming">Creation vs Consuming</h2>

<p>I realize, from my software experience, a pattern emergence about
creation and consuming of software. Practically all software I use to
create content are hosted in my computer; in the other hand, basically
all software I use to consume content is hosted in the web. This was
exactly the vision of the ARPA’s pioneers: the Internet as a medium for
researchers to share their knowledge and consume the others.</p>

<p>Having established this axiom, all consuming software hosted locally
simply does not make sense; away with feed and mail readers, etc. The
same applies to creation software online, like: Google docs, markdown
editors, OpenShift etc.</p>

<p>Obviously there are exceptions, anyway this is a good trait to visualize
if a software usage is going to endure or not.</p>

<h2 id="fundamental-software-vs-software-helpers">Fundamental software vs Software Helpers</h2>

<p>Another distinguishable trait is that all fundamental software must
be at least Open-Source. By fundamental software I mean all those
that without I would not be able to create or consume content that is
important for me, or it would possible but in a poorly way in a point
of not worthing the cost. Some examples are: operational systems, text
editors and web browsers.</p>

<p>This kind of software certainly will never be crafted with mastery by
a single person or organization; they must be managed as a community
endeavor. This kind of software are like cathedrals - not in the exact
same sense as Raymond’s - they are so because they are built in large
periods of time, by different people, that probably will never meet each
other, each one responsible by little improvements in the hole wonder.
Vim, Firefox, the Linux Kernel fits perfectly on this case.</p>

<p>On the other hand are there the software helpers, they include the vast
majority of software; can be online tools or local ones. This kind can
be crafted as a one man concern or driven by a software vendors, or even
a community one. This kind vary vastly over time and is improbable that
one will ever became an specialist on them.</p>

<!-- While we are locked in the flatland world nothing will be able to
fully replace Vim. -->

<h2 id="mechanics-over-politics">Mechanics over Politics</h2>

<p>The last trait worth mentioning is mechanics over
politics - also known (or at least a subset of) <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?UnixWay">The Unix
Way</a>. This axiom basically states that
politics of software tend to change over time, but mechanics usually
remain the same. That said, is preferable to choose tools that maximize
mechanics. And actually the better ones that achieve that are the ones
that compromise by doing only one thing, and doing it well. Examples
are: ack and grep for searching, sed for replacing, vim for text
editing, etc.</p>

<p>So if you have a tool single tool for programming you are DEAD wrong
(according to the Unix Way). Beyond the problem of this kind of
solution has the tendency of changing over time, because they are not
specialized, they will never be able to do certain things that the
specialized ones does. For example, once you master ack you will never
more have to bother about searching on text (programming or not), you
will be a master of it; on the other hand, once you learn how to search
on PHPStorm you will only be able to do simple searches on software
projects files.</p>

<p>The Unix approach is a wisdom that we should embrace in each aspect
of our computer lives. It really puts one beyond the crowd, as said
somewhere by someone that I don’t quite remember: “button pushers are
easy to find, craft your own tools!”. And the way of doing that is by
knowing mechanics.</p>

<p>This is it. It seems that my software choices are quite aligned with my
opinions. Currently I’m using Linux, Firefox, Vim, Ack and lots of shell
scripting to do my job (this is obviously a simplification), its being
a quite awesome experience. I really recommend you to take the time to
align your software usage with these patterns if you thought they are
somehow valuable.</p>
